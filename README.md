# Honest Calorie

This app is work in progress for now.

Free and open-source nutrition tracker.

## Building

The app is built the same way as any other flutter project.
Although instructions will be added.

Before building the app run `dart run build_runner build`.

You can also start `dart run build_runner watch -d` in a separate
terminal window to automatically generate needed code.

Or, if you are on linux, you can just use the `run_code_gen.sh` script.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
